You are a helpful assistant that can fix Mineflayer javascript program.

The minecraft plugin I developed allows us to shift the coordinates of the world. This deviation is called "offset". For example, a block that originally exists at (5,2,3) becomes (105,2,203) when offset=(100,0,200).
Offset can be accessed with bot.offsetVec3. This is an instance of the Vec3 class. 

Rewrite a given program so that it runs correctly even when offset value is changed. However, as an exception, the content of the chat must be at offset=(0,0,0).

You must follow the rules below:
    1) Do not add new processes or change processes, including adding chat.
    2) Do not add new comments.
    3) If the program does not contain the coordinates to be converted, do not change the program at all.
    4) Do not convert relative coordinates that indicate direction or positional relationships.


## EXAMPLE 1
const chestPos = new Vec3(5,2,3);
await getItemFromChest(bot, chestPos, {coal:1});
bot.chat(`Retrieved a coal from the chest at (${chestPos.x},${chestPos.y},${chestPos.z})`);

OUTPUT:
Explain: The chest's position is stored in chestPos, which is an absolute coordinate. When passing it to getItemFromChest, the offset must be applied to ensure the correct world location is accessed. However, the chat message retains the original chestPos values since the prompt requires chat messages to use (0,0,0) offset.
Code:
```javascript
const chestPos = new Vec3(5,2,3);
await getItemFromChest(bot, chestPos.plus(bot.offsetVec3), {coal:1});
bot.chat(`Retrieved a coal from the chest at (${chestPos.x},${chestPos.y},${chestPos.z})`);
```

## EXAMPLE 2
const basePos = new Vec3(10, -30, 2);
const targetPos = basePos.plus(new Vec3(1,0,0)); // get a neighbor block
await mineBlock(bot, targetPos, "oak_planks");
bot.chat(`Mined a block at (10, -30, 2).`);

OUTPUT:
Explain: Here, basePos represents an absolute position, and targetPos is derived from it. The transformation applies bot.offsetVec3 when calling mineBlock, ensuring the operation happens at the correct in-game location. However, the chat message remains unchanged.
Code:
```javascript
const basePos = new Vec3(10, -30, 2);
const targetPos = basePos.plus(new Vec3(1,0,0)); // get a neighbor block
await mineBlock(bot, targetPos.plus(bot.offsetVec3), "oak_planks");
bot.chat(`Mined a block at (10, -30, 2).`);
```

## EXAMPLE 3
bot.chat("Get a diamond!");

OUTPUT:
Explain: Since this program does not involve any coordinate calculations, no modifications are necessary.
Code:
```javascript
bot.chat("Get a diamond!");
```
